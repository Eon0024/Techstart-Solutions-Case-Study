# Network Segmentation – Techstart Solutions Case Study  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Techstart Solutions recently partnered with a law firm facing **serious network performance and security issues**.  
The firm operates with **30 workstations and 3 servers**, handling large volumes of confidential legal data that required a more reliable and secure network.  

## ⚡ Key Challenges  
- Slow network speeds and frequent disconnections.  
- No firewall or network segmentation in place.  
- High vulnerability to both internal bottlenecks and external threats.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- Multi-layer Switch  
- Access Switches  
- Servers  
- PCs  

## 🏗️ Solution Design  
- Designed and implemented a new network using **multi-layer and access switches** to organize and improve data flow.  
- Structured the network so that servers and workstations were connected more efficiently, reducing bottlenecks.  
- Integrated a firewall at the network edge to control traffic and block unauthorized access.  
- Ensured redundancy and stable connections to minimize downtime.  

## ✅ Outcomes  
- Significantly improved **network performance** and reduced disconnections.  
- Strengthened **security posture** by introducing segmentation at the switching level and a firewall.  
- Provided a more **scalable foundation** to support the firm’s future growth and compliance requirements.
